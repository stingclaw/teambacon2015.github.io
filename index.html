				Welcome to Team Bacon, the thing that happened 3 years ago! But however long ago Team Bacon "happened", bacon is still just as good as it ever has been, if not better.
			</div>
			<div>
				Bacon is food. We're <em>pretty</em> sure everyone agrees on that. Bacon is good. Most everyone agrees on that, hopefully as many people as possible. Bacon is awesome. We know some people disagree to that, and it grieves our hearts to think of those people. For this reason, we have created <a href="#">Operation Baconator</a>, an operation to unite the world in the love of bacon, located in an underground facility under Iceland.
			</div>
			<div>
				Operation Baconator will begin transmission in early 2018, and will monitor data collected from the entire world and analyze it, optimizing its baconatorial effects on each region of the world.
